# Transit-Time-analysis-and-prediction

## Overview
This project involves analyzing and predicting transit times for shipments arriving at TRIST-Istanbul, Turkey, and USHOU-Houston, USA. The goal is to enhance accuracy in estimating transit times using statistical analysis and regression modeling techniques.

## Tools and Technologies
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## Steps
1. **Data Collection**: Collected shipment data including arrival and departure times.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Cleaned and preprocessed the data to handle missing values and inconsistencies.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conducted EDA to understand the data distribution and identify patterns.
4. **Feature Engineering**: Created new features to improve model performance.
5. **Model Building**: Built and trained regression models to predict transit times.
6. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluated the models using appropriate metrics and fine-tuned the hyperparameters for better accuracy.
7. **Log Transformation**: Applied log transformation to normalize the data and improve model performance.

## Results
The models achieved satisfactory accuracy in predicting transit times for shipments arriving at TRIST-Istanbul and USHOU-Houston.

## Conclusion
The project demonstrates the application of data science techniques to analyze and predict transit times, which can help improve logistics and supply chain management.
